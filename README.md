Airqmon is a macOS menu bar application that displays live air quality data from the nearest sensor station. It can also notify you when the air quality index changes or when a new, closer station is found.

## Supported data providers

- [Airly][airly] - over 20k sensor stations in many cities around the world in addition to data provided from third-party services like PurpleAir. Check the [Airly map][airly-map] for full coverage.

## Source code-only

Due to the reasons described in [this comment](https://github.com/jsynowiec/airqmon/issues/50#issuecomment-1008751034), I am no longer willing to cover the monthly costs associated with the Airqmon API and Google Geolocation.

I have removed all binaries from the current and previous releases as they will no longer work. You can host the Airqmon API on your own and clone the latest release to build your version of the app.

## Build & installation

1. Clone the [latest release][airqmon-latest-release].
2. Install the dependancies with `yarn install`.
3. Build the binary with `yarn run package`.
4. Drag the binary from the `out` directory to your `Applications` folder.

## Preferences

There are a few options available to customize on the preferences window that you can access by clicking on the button with a cog or by pressing the `⌘ + ,` shortcut.

## Airqmon API

From version 2, Airqmon uses the [Airmon API][airqmon-api], a supplementary service, to find the nearest station and fetch measurements.

## Geolocation

From version 2.1.1, Airqmon uses the free ip-api.com for geolocation. If you want to switch back to the Google Geolocation API, revert the relevant changes from the [1fe51d](https://github.com/jsynowiec/airqmon/commit/1fe51d966f15caeeca1e6385d01b96c6e266210c) commit.

## Privacy

Airqmon application does not track any personally identifiable information or usage analytics.
